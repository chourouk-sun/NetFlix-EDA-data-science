# ðŸŸ  A. Is Netflix producing more TV Shows or Movies over time?

Since 2015, there has been a general increase in the number of titles produced by Netflix. Starting in 2016, the number of movies produced began to increase more significantly than TV shows, and this trend continued over the next several years (2016â€“2020).  Movies have dominated with fast increase until 2019, but also TV Shows have steadily increased especially from 2018 onward.
This suggests that during this period, Netflix shifted its focus more toward movies, likely due to rising audience demand, production flexibility, or strategic goals.
However, it's important to note that after 2019, the overall number of new titles started to decrease, which might be related to external factors such as market saturation or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production schedules.
In recent years, Netflix seems to be balancing TV Shows and Movies production.

# ðŸŸ  B. Most Common Genres

We can observe that International Movies rank at the top, with over 2,500 titles, closely followed by Dramas, which also have around 2,500 titles. This suggests that during this period, there may have been a trend or growing interest in content that explores different cultures and storytelling styles from around the world.

Comedies and International TV Shows have nearly the same number of titles, with comedies slightly ahead. This could indicate that audiences are drawn to light-hearted content, possibly as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday life and work.

Documentaries, Action, and Adventure genres share similar counts, showing a balanced interest in informative and high-energy entertainment.

Similarly, TV Dramas and Independent Movies have roughly the same number of titles, suggesting steady production and interest in more serious or artistic content.

At the bottom of the list, we find Children & Family Movies and Romantic Movies, indicating that these genres are less represented in the dataset, possibly reflecting lower production or niche audiences on Netflix.
 * The most popular genres on Netflix are International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies.
 * Netflix focuses heavily on drama and comedy, which appeals to a broad audience.
